This is a project to make "something" to put in the WWAN slot of my
laptop. This means M.2 NGFF with key B. Lets try to use USB as a
minimum. Maybe som STM32 chip as a start. Maybe it can be connected to
other things. This in turn means a maximum component area of 30mm x
42mm. Meaning TYPE 3042-xx-B. But I gues we could also go with TYPE
2242-xx-B-M, but this is smaller, but should fit a normal WWAN socket
location as well.

Or A + E?  Can we do A + B + E?

Even though there are USB in all of above the USB data lines are NOT
in the same pin location :( ... meaning that we go with the B key for
now as this seems to be the most common keying for WWAN modules for
laptops.

Mechanical constraints:
 - Type 3042-S3-B interface
   - 30x42mm
   - Component maximum height on top layer is 1.5mm
   - B keying
   - Board thickness is 0.8 mm.
   - No components on bottom side

   --- or should it be 2242-S3-B? 22mm instead of 30mm wide?
   - Refer to Table 30 for pinout

SIM card connections could be used for SWD programming
